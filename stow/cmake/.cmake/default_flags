# Default flags passed to `cmdef` bash function. Each parameter is added as a line, where
# the `-D` phrase is prepended to the param before passing it to cmake.
# For example, `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` is passed as `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`
#
# Note: Lines starting with `#` are discarded (i.e., they're comments)
